10 micron all-sky camera 
- Images 
The Images depict a histogram of the entire skies cloud coverage. A Raytheon 300A Mid IR detector is used to produce an RS-170 video signal at a sample rate of 30 Hz for observation.
-Graphs 
The graphs illustrate the skies Standard Deviation and Sky level.
Sky Standard Deviation- is the variation in sky brightness per pixel background vs the time of exposure. This gives rise to Sky Subtraction as well as evaluation of any cloud cover trends 
Sky Level- is a result of the mean background pixel count in an image, illustrating the unidentified parts of detectable objects.
